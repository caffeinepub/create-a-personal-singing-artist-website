# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the artist site draft content to reflect JensyPragya’s identity and include the provided YouTube video/link.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the central artist content source (`frontend/src/content/artistContent.ts`) to replace placeholder identity content with: JensyPragya (name), singer and songwriter, emerging pop/kpop artist, currently living in New Delhi, and upcoming album “Don't Care” (English copy throughout).
- Configure the Videos section content to embed the YouTube video with ID `X6QUk9-Qw1c` and set the YouTube social/link target to `https://youtu.be/X6QUk9-Qw1c?si=h4FpM3omCMSQQiSA` (exactly).

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays JensyPragya’s name and updated bio/album details instead of placeholder content, and the Videos section (and YouTube links in header/footer) correctly show and link to the provided YouTube video.
